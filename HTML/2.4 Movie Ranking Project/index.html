<h1>David's Movie Rankings</h1>
<h2>My favorite movies that I recommend.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>
    This movie was the first thriller that made me really think about and get curious on how society works. <br/>
    Epic action, great plot, beautiful cinematography. <br/>
    Plus this is a movie that is one of its kind in the genre, the only thing that kind of came close after I think was Inception. <br/>
</p>
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>
    Awesome movie describing the life of a mafia boss and intermafia play. <br/>
    Considered a legend in the world of cinematography, I encourage you to find out why ;)). <br/>
    Has some cool themes and interactions that helped me understand society differently, great and nuanced plot too! <br/>
</p>
<h3>Terminator 2</h3>
<p>
    We're in the age of AI now, so its cool to see how similarities and differences of robots and humans play out in a movie. This is a fun movie to see that! <br/>
    Plus Arnold is fcking jacked! Being a bodybuilder isn't my goal but he's been an inspiration for me to hit the gym, been hitting it for a couple months. Hoping to extend it longer! <br/>
    Has some deep philosophical questions that are brought up but you can ignore them if that's not your thing, unlike the other two. <br/>
